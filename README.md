Venco - Open Bicycle Computer

Arduino based bike system analyzing the state of the bike - acceleration, stop, turn direction.
Venco is a device designed to be fitted in a centred, high-mounted position at the rear of a vehicle. Venco analyses the data from the sensors -  gyroscope and the accelerometer and displays the current state of the vehicle - acceleration, braking to a halt, turn direction â€“ through distinct signals and signs on one or several stackable LED matrices, thereby alerting other traffic participants and pedestrians.

The device is equipped with a free slot which allows plugging a wireless module to transmit data also to a LCD display or Google Glasses thus indicating the speed, the acceleration, compass, map and the traffic behind to the cyclist or to the driver.
